      <description>Looking over my POPSUGAR Reading Challenge list for 2022, one thing I already feel a lot better about is that I stuck to the prompts much better this time around (apparently there&amp;rsquo;s this constellation called Carina, and Karina is a variant of the name Carina, and Karenina is like Karina if you drop a few letters&amp;hellip;). I&amp;rsquo;m glad a lot of what I was hoping to read next year managed to fit quite neatly into some of the prompts&amp;mdash;Malcolm X, Giovanni&amp;rsquo;s Room, Journey to the End of the Night, Master and Margarita, and some of the books I didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to reading this year also found space in next year&amp;rsquo;s list&amp;mdash;Grapes of Wrath, Fried Green Tomatoes, Love in the Time of Cholera.</description>

      <description>The last time I did a reading challenge was probably around the same time my GitHub profile photo was taken. After a brief 20-odd-year break, I came across the POPSUGAR Reading Challenge in late 2020, while thinking about which books I wanted to read&amp;mdash;out of my rather dauntingly long TBR list&amp;mdash;over the next year.&#xA;Here is how that list ended up looking after many revisions throughout the year. One thing I really liked about the challenge was that a lot of the prompts pushed me into picking up books that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about before.</description>
