      <description>The last time I did a reading challenge was probably around the same time my GitHub profile photo was taken. After a brief 20-odd-year break, I came across the POPSUGAR Reading Challenge in late 2020, while thinking about which books I wanted to read&amp;mdash;out of my rather dauntingly long TBR list&amp;mdash;over the next year.
Here is how that list ended up looking after many revisions throughout the year. One thing I really liked about the challenge was that a lot of the prompts pushed me into picking up books that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about before.</description>
